# Iktan Smart Home

This is a personal project trying to automate some things at my home just for fun.

## Smart Garage

My garage control is almost at the end of their useful life. Sometimes I have it at my pocket and it opens the garage doors from the backyard, sometimes I forget the remote and I don't have way to open it, so I want a way to control my garage doors. I had some Microsoft toolkits and decided to use them as a upskill project.
